# ðŸ§  numpy-neuralnet

A simple neural network built from scratch using NumPy.

This project demonstrates the core building blocks of a two-layer neural network trained on 2D synthetic datasets like flower pattern, circles, moons, etc. It also includes an interactive Streamlit app for visualization.

## ðŸš€ Features

-   Forward & backward propagation using vectors
-   Parameter updates via gradient descent
-   Support for multiple synthetic datasets
-   Decision boundary visualization
-   Streamlit interface

## Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
