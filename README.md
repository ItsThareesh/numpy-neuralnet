# ðŸ§  numpy-neuralnet

A simple neural network built from scratch using NumPy.

This project demonstrates the core building blocks of a two-layer neural network trained on 2D synthetic datasets like circles, moons, and blobs. It also includes an interactive Streamlit app for visualization.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Forward & backward propagation using vectors
- Parameter updates via gradient descent
- Support for multiple synthetic datasets
- Decision boundary visualization
- Streamlit interface

## Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
