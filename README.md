# ðŸ§  numpy-neuralnet

A simple neural network built from scratch using NumPy.

This project demonstrates the core building blocks of a three-layer neural network trained on 2D synthetic datasets like flower pattern, circles, moons, etc. It also includes an interactive Streamlit app for visualization.
